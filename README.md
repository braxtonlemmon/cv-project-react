# CV Generator Project
Project based on The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application). The application allows the user to enter personal, education, and experience info. Upon submission, a CV is generated that the user can both view and print.

In addition to practicing developing with React, I learned to use [React Hook Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form).
